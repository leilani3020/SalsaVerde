      <h2>Why Network?</h2>
      <p>Travel has become quite common. We visit different cities for different reasons. Salsa dancers may 
      visit a city to see family or for work but while we are there we most likely wonder what the Salsa 
      scene is like and if there is a place for us to dance during our visit.</p>
      <h2>My Traveling Salsa Experience.</h2>
      <p>I have learned that it is difficult to navigate the Salsa scene unless I already know somebody who can 
      tell me where to go. Even the internet can have outdated information regarding places to dance 
      or even none at all. So, my hope 
      is to build a network of Salsa dance information for dancers who travel and don't want to start all 
      over in each new city trying to learn their way around the Salsa scene.</p>
      <h3>Alternate Website</h3>
	<p>In the middle of creating this website, I did come upon a great link that provides 
	  information regarding salsa dancing around the world. Go to 
	  salsapower.com for additional information.</p>
